            <p>In this article, I will establish an understanding of spoken English.</p>

<h1 id="having-a-good-spoken-english-is-crucial">Having a Good Spoken English is Crucial</h1>

<p>Aa a raising researcher, one of the most important skills for me is giving an academic presentation. I do not want to stammer in front of my listeners. I want my listeners to understand me.
If you can speak properly, it somewhat means that your mind is very very clear about the subject you are talking about. Just like individual speaking task in TOEFL, your mind just blank if you do not have any ideas about the question.</p>

<p>The benefit of commanding a spoken language is not only restricted to formal scenarios like above. When you are having an informal conversation with your foreign friends,  you also need to express your opinions correctly, properly, and efficiently. If you do not speak correctly, your friends will not get your meaning, and things will get into trouble. If you do not speak properly, your friends will be offended. If you do not speak efficiently, you are wasting your time.</p>

<p>What I have said above is not restricted to foreign languages, it also applies to our mother language. Indeed, speaking is an ability of our brain. Speaking needs to utilize different parts of our mind. We need to translate our language of thought to spoken language in a sudden. This is in general not an easy task, but once our brain learn this ability, it will no longer be difficult.</p>

<p>(Implicit learning vs Explicit learning)</p>

<p>Speaking in a different scanerio is essentially a new task, so different preparation is needed.</p>

<h1 id="the-physical-qualities-of-spoken-english">The Physical Qualities of spoken English</h1>

<p>Someone once complained to me that their teacher often pauses at some strange point when lecturing. Someone elso complained to me that their teacher speaks a dialect. These are not about how the lecturers organize their contents, but about the physical quality of their speech.</p>

<h2 id="linguistic-features"><em>Linguistic Features</em>:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pronunciation: pronounce vowels, consonants, and their combinations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>intonation: speech music, up and down staircases (includes stressing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>liasons: word connections</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above three features consist of accent. (phonology)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>speed: words per second</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chunk: a unit of information retained in the memory and easily recalled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pauses: for related thoughts, ideas, or breathing (at a suitable time)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>repetitions: No repetitions of words, phrases, and sentences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disfluency: No stuttering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above features consist of fluency.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-language-rules-convert-reading-ability-to-speaking"><em>Theoretical Language Rules</em>: (convert reading ability to speaking)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>vocabulary: lexica</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collocation: relationship between two words</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sentence structure: clauses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They should be both accurate and fancy.</p>

<h2 id="everyday-language-conventions"><em>Everyday Language Conventions</em>:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>politeness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>properness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>authenticity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>TOEFL SpeechRater can automatically evaluate the above features.</p>

<h1 id="the-content-of-spoken-english">The Content of Spoken English</h1>

<p>Assume the physical qualities of your spoken English are all qualified, that is, you can read out any written passage perfectly. But, if you were asked a TOEFL speaking question and were only given 15 second to prepare, would you succeed? If we regard the physical qualities as computer hardware, then the content is more similar to computer software.</p>

<h2 id="topic-development"><em>Topic Development</em>:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discourse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples &amp; Details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that TOEFL SpeechRater can not evaluate this aspect. Human rater can evaluate this.</p>
