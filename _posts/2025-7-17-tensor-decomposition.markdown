This is a note on [tensor decomposition](https://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/docs/bookexv2.pdf). 



# Motivation: The Rotation Problem



# Tensor Decomposition

$$
T=\sum_{i=1}^r u^{(i)}\otimes v^{(i)}\otimes w^{(i)}
$$


# Jennrich's Algorithm




Guarantees for Jennrich's Algorithm can be easily founded by the perburbation bounds [Chap 3.4]().

# Applications 

Where can we apply the tensor decomposition?


### Phylogenetic Trees and HMMs

### Community Detection



### Independent Component Analysis
