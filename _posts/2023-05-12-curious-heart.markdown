title: All You Need is a Curious Heart

Before I have read Paul Krugman's The Age of Diminishing Expectation, now I barely remember what he wrote, only rememeber that he is a distinguished professor in trading. Today I come across The Theory of Interstellar Trade he wrote in 1978 named, and I finally realized why he was awarded the Nobel prize.

The distinguished applied mathematician Joseph. B. Keller once wrote an article called Ponytail Motion.

As we often say, Ig Nobel Prize is the way to Nobel Prize, but why is that? Commanding critical thinking tools and curriculum learning are necessary but not sufficient condition for academic success. There is no theory for success, and success is not a well defined concept if we really think in a philosophical way. 

There is no need to comply to any kind of convention. 

All you need is a curious heart.
