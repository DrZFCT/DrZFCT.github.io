title: "Introduction of Statistics"
author: 刘锴昭
---

GRE verbal与中学语文题目其实有些类似。这次我们的主角——introduction of statistics，就是列数字。GRE中问列数字的作用的题目实际上比较少见。

请各位看官看题目：

There have been numerous well-documented extinctions of indigenous species caused by the introduction of non-indigenous predators and pathogens. However, surprisingly few extinctions of indigenous species can be attributed to competition from introduced species. For example, during the past 400 years, 4,000 plant species have been introduced into North America, and these non-indigenous plants currently account for nearly 20 percent of North America`s plant species. Yet no evidence exists that any indigenous North American plant species became extinct as a result of competition from new species could mean that such extinctions take longer to occur than scientists initially believed or, alternatively, that extinctions are rarely caused by competition from non-indigenous species.



The passage is concerned primarily with
- A. pointing out that a particular type of species extinction is rarely known to occur.
- B. proposing a possible explanation for conflicting data about a particular type of species extinction.
- C. resolving a debate about the frequency of a particular type of species extinction.
- D. comparing two theories regarding possible causes of a particular type of species extinction.
- E. refuting a proposed explanation for the increasingly rare occurrence of a particular type of species extinction.

The author introduces statistics about North America`s non-indigenous plant species primarily in order to
- A. undermine a proposed explanation for the absence of any evidence for the occurrence of a particular phenomenon
- B. contrast the effect of introduced plant species in North America with the effect that introduced animal species have had
- C. suggest that North America`s indigenous plants are a domain in which there has been ample scope for a particular effect to have occurred
- D. emphasize how much the ecology of North America has been affected over the past 400 years by the introduction of non-indigenous species
- E. substantiate a claim about the overall effect that the introduction of non-indigenous species tends to have on indigenous populations

第一题问主旨，根据GRE: READING COMPREHENSION中描述的方法，主旨为加粗句。直接选A。

第二题问列数字的作用。这个句子紧跟主旨句，句子的作用当然是支撑主旨。但题目问的是文章中画线的数据的作用，这个数据当然体现不出主旨，所以E这种看似正确的选项当然是不合适的。此外，E对主旨的描述也不准确，overall effect太广泛了。正确答案是C，C选项首先描述了数字本身的作用：（注意虚拟语气）这么多外来植物，明明可以发生；接下来的句子说结果没发生，那么整句话不就是支持了主旨吗？


此外，列数字作为说明方法，在小学“讲”说明文时就“学”过，可是有几个小学生真正明白列数字的意义？离开批判性阅读，这些说明方法、以至论证方法，都是云里雾里，莫名其妙。何必要为难小学生呢？硬塞给小学生这些说明方法，也不解释是从何处来，从何处去，莫名其妙蹦出一个说明文，莫名其妙做一些诠释，然后让小学生背诵，浪费小学生的青春，到最后也没学会批判性阅读，也无法在信息爆棚的现代社会获得一些辨识力。仔细审视一下自己十二年学到的东西，看看有多少时间是被教育体制浪费掉的？迂腐的老头们高高在上，指手画脚，毁了一代人的青春。在体制中经历过，并且打败了体制的年轻人们，就是最有资格指手画脚的人，就是最懂教育的人。
