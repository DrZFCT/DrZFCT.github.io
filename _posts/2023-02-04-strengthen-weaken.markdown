本篇文章旨在提示阅读题与逻辑单题中的加强/削弱题的思考方式的不同。同样都是不属于文章的信息，阅读中的这类题，正确答案不能离开原文；而逻辑单题可以。

先看逻辑单题中的一道加强题。

Although several ancient cultures practiced mummification, mummies from ancient Egypt are generally more well-preserved than mummies of similar antiquity from other cultures. One possible explanation for this difference is that the mummification techniques or material used by ancient Egyptians were better than those of other cultures. A second, more likely, explanation is that the extremely dry climate of ancient Egypt was largely responsible, given that dryness promotes the preservation of organic remains generally.

Which is the following provide the most support for the argument?

A. The materials used by ancient Egyptians for mummification were not used by any other ancient culture that practiced mummification
B. Some ancient Egyptian mummies are better preserved than other ancient Egyptian mummies form around the same time.
C. No ancient people living in very damp areas practiced mummification.
D. Bodies from ancient Egyptian tombs dating from before the practice of mummification began are almost as well preserved as ancient Egyptian mummies.
E. Ancient mummies discovered in places other than Egypt have typically not been as well protected from the elements as ancient Egyptian mummies were.

观点是：更可能是气候原因造成的，而不是技术。D选项很完美，甚至完美的过头了，个人感觉这个在现实中不存在，但不要因为这个影响选择。C选项相对D比较间接，由于题目要求选最强的，答案为D。


可以看出，逻辑单题中选项和原文通常跳出原文，甚至跳出现实。

下面再看以下阅读的第三题。

Architectural morphology is the study of how shifting cultural and environmental conditions produce changes in an architectural form. When applied to the mission churches of New Mexico exemplifying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spanish colonial architecture in what is now the southwestern United States, architectural morphology reveals much about how Native American culture transformed the traditional European church architecture of the Spanish missionaries who hoped to convert Native Americans to Christianity. 

Many studies of these mission churches have carefully documented the history and design of their unique architectural form, most attribute the churches' radical departure from their sixteenth-century European predecessors to local climate and a less-mechanized building technology. Certainly, the limitations imposed by manual labor and the locally available materials of mud-brick and timber necessitated a divergence from the original European church model. However, the emergence of a church form suited to life in the Southwest was rooted in something more fundamental than material and technique. The new architecture resulted from cultural forces in both the Spanish colonial and indigenous Native American societies, each with competing ideas about form and space and different ways of conveying these ideas symbolically.

For example, the mission churches share certain spatial qualities with the indigenous kiva, a round, partly subterranean room used by many Southwest Native American communities for important rituals. Like the kiva it was intended to replace, the typical mission church had thick walls of adobe (sun-dried earth and straw), a beaten-earth floor, and one or two small windows. In deference to European custom, the ceilings of these churches were higher than those of the traditional kiva. However, with the limited lighting afforded by their few small windows, these churches still suggest the kiva's characteristically low, boxlike, earth-hugging interior. Thus, although pragmatic factors of construction may have contributed to the shape of the mission churches, as earlier studies suggest, the provision of a sacred space consistent with indigenous traditions may also have been an important consideration in their design.

The continued viability of the kiva itself in Spanish mission settlements has also been underestimated by historians. Freestanding kivas discovered in the ruins of European-style missionary communities have been explained by some historians as examples of "superposition". Under this theory, Christian domination over indigenous faiths is dramatized by surrounding the kiva with Christian buildings. However, as James Ivey points out, such superposition was unlikely, since historical records indicate that most Spanish missionaries, arriving in the Southwest with little or no military support, wisely adopted a somewhat conciliatory attitude toward the use of the kiva at least initially. This fact, and the careful, solitary placement of the kiva in the center of the mission-complex courtyards, suggests an intention to highlight the importance of the kiva rather than to diminish it.

The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. correct some misinterpretations about the development of an architectural form
B. compare the traditional church architectures of two different cultures
C. examine the influence of a religious architectural style on secular buildings
D. explain the nature of the contrast between two different architectural styles
E. trace the European roots of an architectural style used in the United States

The passage suggests that the indicated historians regarded the placement of kivas in the midst of Christian buildings as which of the following?
A. exemplary of an arrangement of religious buildings typical of a kind of Native American architecture common prior to the arrival of the Spanish
B. largely responsible for the evolution of a distinctive Spanish mission architectural style
C. indicative of the Spanish missionaries' desire to display an attitude of acceptance toward the kiva
D. symbolic of the controversy among Spanish missionaries in New Mexico regarding their treatment of the indigenous population
E. reflective of the Spanish missionary's desire to diminish the kiva's importance

Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument about the Spanish missionaries' attitude toward the kiva?
A. The period of most intensive settlement by Spanish missionaries in the Southwest occurred before the period in which the mission churches of New Mexico were built.
B. There are no traces of kivas in Spanish mission settlements that were protected by a large military presence.
C. Little of the secular Spanish colonial architecture of the Southwest of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is predominantly European in style.
D. Some Spanish missionary communities of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were attached to Spanish military installations.
E. New Mexico contains by far the largest concentration of Spanish mission-style church architecture in the United States.

According to the passage, the building techniques prevailing in the Southwest during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries played a role in which of the following?
A. preventing missionaries in the Southwest from duplicating traditional European churches
B. influencing missionaries in the Southwest to incorporate a freestanding kiva into certain mission settlements
C. causing missionaries in the Southwest to limit the building of churches to New Mexico only
D. jeopardizing the viability of Spanish religious settlements throughout the Southwest
E. encouraging many missionaries in the Southwest to reexamine the continued viability of a highly ceremonial European religious tradition

答案为AEBA。第三题是加强题，作者的argument是斜体句，观点是：没有军队，传教士采取了conciliatory的态度。B选项说如果有军队，那么就不会有kiva，这就说明了，之前形成这种建筑模式，只是妥协的结果，而不是占优，这加强了作者的argument，并很有力的反驳了上一句的观点。C选项推而广之到secular architecture，固然有加强作用，但是就如本篇文章想强调的，与阅读题不符。
