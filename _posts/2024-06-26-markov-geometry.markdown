This is my note for the book [Analysis and Geometry of Markov Diffusion Operators](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-00227-9).
This note mean to demonstrate the basic ideas and calculations, simplifying the technical details to as few lines as possible while maintaining rigor.

Mixing.
