title: Stability of Lindblad's Equation
author: Kaizhao Liu

---

Under certain conditions the evolution of a quantum system interacting with its environment can be described by a quantum dynamical semigroup and shown to satisfy a Lindblad master equation

$$
 \dot{\rho}(t)=-i[H,\rho]+\cL_D\rho(t)
$$

where $\rho(t)$ is positive unit-trace operator



# Bloch Representation

From a mathematical point of view the Lindblad master equation is a complex matrix differential equation.
To use dynamical systems tools to study its stationary solutions and the stability, it is desirable to find a real representation for 
by choosing an orthonormal basis $\fbf \sigma=\\{\sigma_k\\}_{k=1}^{N^2}$ for all Hermitian matrices on $\cH$.
