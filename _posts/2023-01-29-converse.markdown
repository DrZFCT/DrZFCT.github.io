在逻辑学中,对于一个条件命题，我们有如下三种：

| Name                   | Logic       |
|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Statement                | If p, then q.           |
| Converse                     | If q, then p.           |
| Inverse                      | If not p, then not q.   |
| Contrapositive               | If not q, then not p.   |




converse statement与inverse statement是逻辑等价的。

而conversely在英语中通常用于连接原命题与（广泛意义上的）inverse statement。

比如Merriam-Webster网站上的例句：

If this active gene is a mutation that would otherwise have been recessive, it can lead to disease. Conversely, if the silenced gene is harmful in some way, imprinting can be beneficial.

以及另一道GRE题目：

Laws protecting intellectual property are intended to stimulate creativity, yet some forms of creative work have never enjoyed legal protection-a situation that ought to be of great interest. If we see certain forms of creative endeavor (i)_____ as a result of uncontrolled copying, we might decide to (ii)_____ intellectual property law. Conversely, if unprotected creative work (iii)_____ in the absence of legal rules against copying, we would do well to know how such flourishing is sustained.

| Blank (i)         | Blank (ii)    | Blank (iii)           |
| :-----------------: |:-------------: | :---------------------: |
| A.languishing     | D.jettison    | G.declines in originality |
| B.proliferating   | E.extend      | H.manages to thrive   |
| C.diversifying    | F.relax       | I.openly invite imitation |


此题(iii)应该与flourishing相同，故选H。根据conversely的逻辑，(i)(iii)应该意思相对立，所以(i)选A，这时(ii)自然选E。

回到原题，根据conversely的逻辑，(iii)应该与accused of意思相对立，原来把小说内容写的像作者自传会被人指责，那么现在这么写应该会受人欢迎，所以是sell as。如果不强调conversely的逻辑，其他的选项放到句子里也能说得通。
