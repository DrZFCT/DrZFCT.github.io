In this note, I sketch the most fundamental ideas and algorithms developed in the traditional field of numerical analysis. If permitted, I also sketch the mathematical analysis of such algorithms. The material means to establish an understanding of this field as easy as possible, thus all implementation and technical details are omitted.
