Conventionally, the ultimate measure of a scientific work’s validity is how broadly and confidently its conclusions become accepted in the relevant field, which in turn derives from the extent to which its findings are replicated and extended. However, establishing such validity, especially for a novel experimental finding, can take years, and what constitutes replication or extension may be disputed for some time.

此题答案为：AFH

此题(ii)(iii)空相对简单，我们这里只讨论(i)。A选项与C选项的影响方向正好相反。此时难道要看句意来判断吗？当然不，因为看句意来决定这个影响关系消耗太多时间，而且不一定能得到正确答案，毕竟how broadly and confidently its conclusions become accepted in the relevant field与the extent to which its findings are replicated and extended的决定关系比较模糊，从这里入手没有绝对的说服力。

这里的奥妙在于in turn。设有两件事A,B，用箭头表示影响方向，记A影响B为
$$ A \rightarrow B $$
相应地，B影响A为
$$ B \rightarrow A $$

我们有如下例句，这里句子结构都是：
$$ A\_\_B,\text{in turn},B\_\_C $$
其中__填写的内容有影响方向，或者说一个箭头方向。

- These developments have *led to* a far higher proportion of successful operations, which **in turn** has *led to* great demand for transplants. 



- Stress *causes* your body to release chemicals, which **in turn** *boost* blood pressure.



- Almost everything we do *depends on* our modern devices, and these **in turn** *depend on* scientific principles. 



- Volcanic carbon dioxide would *cause* atmospheric warming that would, **in turn**, *warm* surface ocean water.



- Economic development is certainly *affecting* culture and customs, which, **in turn**, are *reacting on* what is going on in the economy. 



- The brain *has* a limited capacity to perform controlled processing which **in turn** *limits* the first stage of skill acquisition.



- Skin color *depends upon* a number of variables, each of which, **in turn**, *is determined by* several genes.



- A sea-urchin egg *is surrounded by* a protective covering known as the vitelline envelope, which **in turn** *is covered with* a thick coat of jelly.



- He says the company has an obligation to *help* the local economy, and this **in turn** *helps* the company.



- Arabic *is a branch of* the Semitic languages, which **in turn** *belongs to* the Afro-Asiatic language family together with Berber, Ancient Egyptian, Chadic, and Cushitic.



- For instance, an economy that is growing quickly would *tend to* overheat and this **in turn** is likely to *lead to* a higher inflation and asset bubbles.



- Pessimism about their earning potential could *be preventing* women *from* pushing for higher wages or a promotion, and this, **in turn**, could *be helping to* sustain the gender pay gap.

可以发现，只要是形如这样的句子，空格处的箭头方向一定相同。这就是in turn的用法。一言蔽之，in turn前后重复的讨论对象，动作方向相反，就像轮流传递下去，这也和in turn的本义相合。

回到原题，the measure of A is B说明A被B决定，那么B被C决定，所以填derives from。



最后留下一句话，大家看看能不能理解这里的in turn呢？

Who *shuts* love out, in turn shall *be shut out* from love.
