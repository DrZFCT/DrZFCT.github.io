Circuit complexity is a measure of how hard it is to express or compute a boolean function.

# Boolean Functions
*Boolean functions* can be classified according to the size or depth of the *Boolean circuits* that compute them.

A Boolean circuit with $n$ input bits is a directed acyclic graph in which every node is either an input node labelled by one of the 
$n$ input bits, an AND gate, an OR gate, or a NOT gate. The input node has in-degree 0, the AND gate has in-degree 2, 


# A Motivating Example


# Circuit Lower Bound


# $NC^0\subsetneq AC^0 \subsetneq TC^0\subset NC^1 \subset P$
