In this article I introduce some words from French.



# sangfroid

French sang-froid, literally, cold blood

: self-possession or imperturbability especially under strain

e.g. He displayed remarkable sangfroid when everyone else was panicking during the crisis.



# phantasmagoria

borrowed from French phantasmogorie (later fantasmagorie) "theatrical show using magic lanterns in a darkened performance space to suggest supernatural phenomena,"

: an exhibition of optical effects and illusions

: a scene that constantly changes; : a constantly shifting complex succession of things seen or imagined

e.g. Before the development of a protocol to fend off the raptures, there was every chance that what a diver witnessed on their descent was a phantasmagoria of the mind, as much as of the ocean.

: a bizarre or fantastic combination, collection, or assemblage

e.g. Rhapsody was a phantasmagoria of different abstractions.





# rapprochement

French, from rapprocher to bring together

: establishment of or state of having cordial relations

e.g. Officials hope that these talks will lead to a rapprochement with the rebels.



# malinger

French malingre sickly

: to pretend or exaggerate incapacity or illness (as to avoid duty or work)

e.g. His boss suspected him of malingering because of his frequent absences from work.



# complaisant

French, from Middle French, from present participle of complaire to gratify, acquiesce, from Latin complacēre

: marked by an inclination to please or oblige

: tending to consent to others' wishes

Note: complacent means self-satisfied.



# cataclysm

French cataclysme, from Latin cataclysmos, from Greek kataklysmos, from kataklyzein to inundate, from kata- + klyzein to wash

: flood, deluge

: a violent and sudden change in a feature of the earth

: a momentous and violent event marked by overwhelming upheaval and demolition

e.g. The sudden cataclysm prompted comparisons to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank whose implosion helped set off the 2008 financial crisis.

broadly : an event that brings great changes

# canard

French, literally, duck; from Middle French vendre des canards à moitié to cheat, literally, to half-sell ducks
: a false or unfounded report or story; a groundless rumor or belief
e.g. Trump’s supposed resistance to war was always a canard.

# hauteur
French, from haut high
: arrogance, haughtiness
e.g. Cats are not thought to be such selfless creatures, what with their hauteur and froideur and general aura of disregard.
Note: froideur, think about sangfroid!
# chagrin
French, from chagrin sad

: disquietude or distress of mind caused by humiliation, disappointment, or failure

e.g. Imagine my chagrin when a whiz kid from Dayton made all A's in the first quarter while I made two B's and a C+.

: to vex or unsettle by disappointing or humiliating

e.g. Despite a scolding from the governor chagrined by news photos that seemed to show unsafe clusters of beachgoers the weekend before, many of who had driven in from L.A., Newport Beach leaders voted 5-2 to keep the beach open.



# camaraderie

French, from camarade comrade

: a spirit of friendly good-fellowship

e.g. Except for occasional bursts of camaraderie, which came like thunderstorms, we were never close.
